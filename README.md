<h1 align="center">Build a User Management System</h1>
<b>Description:</b>
You are tasked with building a user management system using PHP. The system should allow administrators to manage users, including creating, updating, and deleting user accounts. Regular users should be able to view and update their own profiles.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<b>User Roles and Permissions:</b>
</br>
Implement at least two user roles: "Administrator" and "User".
</br>
Administrators should have the ability to manage all user accounts (CRUD operations).
</br>
Users should only be able to view and update their own profile information.
</br>
<b>Authentication and Authorization:</b>
</br>
Implement a secure authentication mechanism. Users should be able to log in with their email and password.
</br>
Use sessions or tokens to manage user sessions.
</br>
Ensure that only authorized users can access their respective functionalities.
</br>
<b>User Profile:</b>
Users should have a profile page displaying their information (name, email, etc.).
</br>
Users should be able to update their own profile information.
</br>
</br>
<b>User Listing:</b>
Administrators should have access to a user listing page showing all users.
</br>
Implement pagination for the user listing to handle a potentially large number of users.
</br>
</br>
<b>User Creation and Editing:</b>
Administrators should be able to create new user accounts, providing necessary information such as name, email, and role.
</br>
Editing of user information should be available to administrators.
</br>
<b>User Deletion:</b>
Administrators should be able to delete user accounts.
</br>
Implement a confirmation mechanism to prevent accidental deletions.
</br>
<b>Security Considerations:</b>
Sanitize and validate input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
</br>
Use password hashing for user authentication.
</br>
Implement CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
</br>
<b>UI/UX:</b>
Design a user-friendly interface using HTML/CSS.
</br>
Ensure responsive design to support different devices.
</br>
<b>Code Quality and Best Practices:</b>
Follow SOLID principles and MVC architecture (or other appropriate architectural pattern).
</br>
Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
</br>
Implement error handling and logging for better debugging.
</br>
<b>Testing:</b>
Write unit tests for critical components of the application.
</br>
Ensure proper test coverage.
</br>
<b>Submission:</b>
You are required to provide the source code along with any necessary setup instructions. Additionally, provide a brief document explaining your design decisions, technologies used, and any challenges faced during development.

Yii 2 Basic Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
rapidly creating small projects.

The template contains the basic features including user login/logout and a contact page.
It includes all commonly used configurations that would allow you to focus on adding new
features to your application.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 7.4.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](https://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install with Docker

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist
    
Run the installation triggers (creating cookie validation code)

    docker-compose run --rm php composer install    
    
Start the container

    docker-compose up -d
    
You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

**NOTES:** 
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.


TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](https://codeception.com/).
By default, there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
vendor/bin/codecept run
```

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser. 


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full-featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ```

    In case of using Selenium Server 3.0 with Firefox browser since v48 or Google Chrome since v53 you must download [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) or [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and launch Selenium with it:

    ```
    # for Firefox
    java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=~/geckodriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar
    
    # for Google Chrome
    java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=~/chromedriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar
    ``` 
    
    As an alternative way you can use already configured Docker container with older versions of Selenium and Firefox:
    
    ```
    docker run --net=host selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
    ```

5. (Optional) Create `yii2basic_test` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/test_db.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   vendor/bin/codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
vendor/bin/codecept run --coverage --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
vendor/bin/codecept run unit --coverage --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
vendor/bin/codecept run functional,unit --coverage --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
